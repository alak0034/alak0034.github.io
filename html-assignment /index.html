        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello, I'm Suhailah, a passionate <em>designer</em> and <abbr title="photographer">photographer</abbr>. I love bringing creativity to life, whether it's through the lens of a camera or through vibrant, thoughtful designs. My journey started with an interest in the natural world, which led me to explore nature photography. Now, I am working towards becoming a professional portrait photographer and establishing my own studio.</p>

        <p>Besides photography, I enjoy the peaceful and calm feeling that my favorite color, <em>white</em>, evokes. I believe in finding balance between creativity and simplicity. My goal is to blend aesthetics with meaning in every project I work on. I'm continuously learning and growing in my craft, and I hope to inspire others through my work.</p>
